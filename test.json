So, I think what the mindsdb_server should send to the GUI when it answers a query would be:

  'column_name': {
    'value': 'Val1',
    'confidence': 0.85,
    'confidence_influence_scores': {

    },
    ,'important_missing_columns': ['col5','col6']
    'other_likely_predictions': [
      {
        'value': 'Val2'

      {

        'confidence': 0.05
      }
    ]
  }
}

  ,'confidence'


}

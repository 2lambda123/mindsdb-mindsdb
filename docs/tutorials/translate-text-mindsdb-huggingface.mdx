## Introduction

In today's world, just about anything you want to know can be found online. The internet has completely revolutionized the way we share information. Internet reviews, social media comments, forums and messages have become significant. Put simply, the internet is now society's main form of communication... and it holds a lot of valuable data. Thanks to advances in technology, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can now be used to extract meaningful insights from this data. 

In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to use MindsDB and Hugging Face to identify spam in a multilingual dataset.

## Data Setup

We're going to use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download) for this tutorial. Our **datasource** will be PostgreSQL.

Make sure you have a working [MindsDB Cloud Acccount](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/) or a local installation of MindsDB running so you can follow along with this tutorial. I'm going to be using Docker to run MindsDB locally. You can learn how to setup Docker for MindsDB using the following resources:

- **Video:** [Setting Up Docker for MindsDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadY-cUpUm0&t=39s)
- **Docs:** [Setup for Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker)

If you want to learn how to set up your account at MindsDB Cloud, follow
[this guide](/setup/cloud/). Another way is to set up
MindsDB locally using
[Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) or
[Python](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

### Connecting the Data

#### Adding Data in MindsDB Cloud Editor

The instructions for importing data using MindsDB's Cloud Editor go as follows:

1. Visit [MindsDB Cloud Editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/)
2. Click 'Login' or 'Create Account' and authenticate
3. Once logged in, click **Add Data**
4. Select **"Files"**
5. Click **"Import File"**
6. Choose the file to import
7. Name your dataset accordingly (no special characters or cases in db name)
8. Use `SELECT` SQL command to confirm the data was uploaded successfully:

***input:***
```sql
SELECT * FROM files.dataset LIMIT 3;
```

#### Local Setup

I'm going to be working locally, so I'll start by heading over to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and downloading [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download). 

### Understanding the Data

The dataset we are working with contains **multilingual spam data** for English, Hindi, German, and French. It is primarily used to test to test the zero-shot transfer for text classification using pretrained language models. The original data was in English and was Machine Translated in Hindi, German and French. The dataset contained the multilingual text and corresponding labels:

- ham- non spam text
- spam- spam text

Currently, MindsDB supports the following translation models:

 -[x] English to French T5
 -[x] French to English T5
 -[x] Spanish to English

{/* This dataset contains a few columns that are not supported by MindsDB at this time, so my next step is to simply open that `.csv` file and remove the following columns:
-  "text_hi" 
- "text_de" */}

Now that I have my dataset, I'm going to use it to build my PostgreSQL database:



***output:***
```
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| labels |             text           |      text_hi   |             text_de  |   text_fr                         |
+------------+--- ---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| ham    | 'Go until jurong, crazy..' | 'Dakag बिंदु तक.'  | 'Gehen bis jurong..'| 'Allez jusqu...'                  |
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| ham   | 'Ok lar... Joking wif u...' | `ओके लामर.... `   | `Ok... joking'   | `J'ai fait une blague sur le wif...`|
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| spam  | 'Free entry in 2 a wkly...' | 'Fktatatat मई...'| 'Freier Eintrit' | 'Entrée libre dans 2 a wkly comp...'|
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
```

## Introduction
In today's world, just about anything you want to know can be found online. The internet has completely revolutionized the way we share information. Internet reviews, social media comments, forums and messages have become significant sources of information. Put simply, the internet is now society's main form of communication... and it holds a lot of valuable data. Thanks to advances in technology, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can now be used to extract meaningful insights from this data. 

### What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. Some ways you use NLP in your everyday life include voice-operated GPS, digital assistants (like, Siri) and voice-to-text..

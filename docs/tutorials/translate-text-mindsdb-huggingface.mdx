## Introduction

In today's world, just about anything you want to know can be found online. The internet has completely revolutionized the way we share information. Internet reviews, social media comments, forums and messages have become significant. Put simply, the internet is now society's main form of communication... and it holds a lot of valuable data. Thanks to advances in technology, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can now be used to extract meaningful insights from this data. 

In today's tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can perform translation queries on your dataset with MindsDB, PostgreSQL and Hugging Face.

## Data Setup

We're going to use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download) for the text content in this tutorial. 
Once we import our data, we're going to use HuggingFace's [BERT multilingual base model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) to translate multilingual spam data (German, English, French) to English.

Make sure you have a working [MindsDB Cloud Acccount](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/) or a local installation of MindsDB running so you can follow along with this tutorial. 

### Connecting the Data

For this turorial, we're going to use a table from MindsDB's PostgreSQL public demo instance. We're 

Thanks to MindsDB's advanced technology, we can use the SQL 'CREATE DATABASE' statement to connect our data.

## Introduction

In today's world, just about anything you want to know can be found online. The internet has completely revolutionized the way we share information. Internet reviews, social media comments, forums and messages have become significant. Put simply, the internet is now society's main form of communication... and it holds a lot of valuable data. Thanks to advances in technology, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can now be used to extract meaningful insights from this data. 

In today's tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can perform translation queries on your dataset with MindsDB, PostgreSQL and Hugging Face.

## Data Setup

We're going to use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download) for the text content in this tutorial. 
Once we import our data, we're going to use HuggingFace's [BERT multilingual base model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) to translate multilingual spam data (German, English, French) to English.

Make sure you have a working [MindsDB Cloud Acccount](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/) or a local installation of MindsDB running so you can follow along with this tutorial. 

If you want to learn how to set up your account at MindsDB Cloud, follow
[this guide](/setup/cloud/). Another way is to set up
MindsDB locally using
[Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) or
[Python](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

### Connecting the Data

I'm working in MindsDB's Cloud Editor for this tutorial, so I'm going to start by doing the following:

1. Visit [MindsDB Cloud Editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/)
2. Click 'Login' or 'Create Account' and authenticate
3. Once logged in, click **Add Data**
4. Select **"Files"**
5. Click **"Import File"**
6. Choose the file to import
7. Name your dataset accordingly (no special characters or cases in db name)
8. Use `SELECT` SQL command to confirm the data was uploaded successfully:

***input:***
```sql
SELECT * FROM files.dataset LIMIT 3;
```

***output:***
```
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| labels |             text           |      text_hi   |             text_de  |   text_fr                         |
+------------+--- ---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| ham    | 'Go until jurong, crazy..' | 'Dakag बिंदु तक.'  | 'Gehen bis jurong..'| 'Allez jusqu...'                  |
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| ham   | 'Ok lar... Joking wif u...' | `ओके लामर.... `   | `Ok... joking'   | `J'ai fait une blague sur le wif...`|
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| spam  | 'Free entry in 2 a wkly...' | 'Fktatatat मई...'| 'Freier Eintrit' | 'Entrée libre dans 2 a wkly comp...'|
+------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE nlp_translate
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "3.220.66.106",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "demo"
    };
```


## Creating a Predictor

Now that our data is ready, we're going to use MindsDB's built-in SQL editor to create our prediction model. 

```sql
CREATE MODEL text_translation
PREDICT translation
USING
   engine = 'huggingface',
   task = 'translation',
   model_name = "bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased",
   input_column = 'text',
   labels = ['text_english','text_french','text_german'];
```

Upon first running this command I actually received the following output:

```
401 Client Error. (Request ID: Root=1-641bb7e4-1c00c0800f51a8b75622e267)

Repository Not Found for url: https://huggingface.co/api/models/bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased.
Please make sure you specified the correct `repo_id` and `repo_type`.
If you are trying to access a private or gated repo, make sure you are authenticated.
Invalid username or password.
```

After seeing this message, I simply copied the link provided by the output <https://huggingface.co/api/models/bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased> and pasted it into Chrrome. I was brought to a login screen, which tells me I need an account with HuggingFace if I want to use this model transformer.

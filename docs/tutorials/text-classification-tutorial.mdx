## Introduction

In today's world, digital conversation is king. Whether it be text message, email, or social media we do the majority of our communicating in a virtual setting. With all this information spreading around, negativity is bound to happen. Luckily, new advances in NLP bring opportunity to identify (and ween out) the bad, or hateful, text content out there using automated processes.

In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can use MindsDB and Hugging Face to classify hate speech in your database. Before we begin, let's go over some core concepts that you should probably know:

[MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) is is an open-source AI layer for existing databases that allows you to effortlessly develop, train and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models using SQL queries. 
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a community and data science platform that provides tools that enables users to build, train and deploy machine learning models based on open source code and technologies. 
**NLP**, or Natural Language Processing, is a subprocess of artificial intelligence that helps machines process and understand the human langage so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks. 
Some examples of NLP include machine translation, summarization, ticket classification, and spell check (or "autocorrect").

## Data Setup

Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation, either locally or via [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). 

*You can create a **free** MindsDB account and take advantage of their built-in SQL editor [here](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor).*

If you want to learn more about creating a free MindsDB Cloud account, follow
[this guide](/setup/cloud/). Another way is to set up
MindsDB locally using
[Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) or
[Python](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

Let's get started!

## Training a Predictor
I'm going to start by creating my predictor, 

```sql
CREATE MODEL hate_predictor
PREDICT tolerance
USING
  engine = 'huggingface',
  task = 'text-classification',
  model_name = "Hate-speech-CNERG/bert-base-uncased-hatexplain",
  input_column = 'comment',
  labels = ['normal','offensive','hate_speech'];
```

```sql
| NAME | ENGINE | PROJECT | ACTIVE | VERSION | STATUS | ACCURACY | PREDICT | UPDATE_STATUS | MINDSDB_VERSION | ERROR | SELECT_DATA_QUERY | TRAINING_OPTIONS | TAG |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| hate_predictor | huggingface | mindsdb | true | 1 | generating | [NULL] | tolerance | up_to_date | 23.3.4.0 | [NULL] | [NULL] | {'target': 'tolerance', 'using': {'task': 'text-classification', 'model_name': 'Hate-speech-CNERG/bert-base-uncased-hatexplain', 'input_column': 'comment', 'labels': ['normal', 'offensive', 'hate_speech']}} | [NULL] |
```

If your syntax and models are correct, you should see output similar to the above. Your predictor will most likely be in the `generating` phase at this point.

**Make sure the above query does not return an error. This could mean there is an error in your code or you are using an unsupported 3rd party model. If you receive erroneous or unexpected output, reach out to the MindsDB Community on Slack for suppor

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.models 
WHERE name = 'hate_predictor`
```

## Introduction


## Data Setup

Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation, either locally or via [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). 

*You can create a **free** MindsDB account and take advantage of their built-in SQL editor [here](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor).*

If you want to learn more about creating a free MindsDB Cloud account, follow
[this guide](/setup/cloud/). Another way is to set up
MindsDB locally using
[Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) or
[Python](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

Let's get started!

## Connecting The Data

Let's start by connecting to MindsDB's MySQL API:

`mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 47335 -u mindsdb`

output:

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1
Server version: 5.7.1-MindsDB-1.0 (MindsDB)

Copyright (c) 2000, 2023, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
```

Now I want to confirm the connection was successful, so I'm just going to display the tables in MindsDB:

` SHOW TABLES;`

The output should display your MindsDB tables:

```
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_mindsdb    |

# Introduction

  Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool used to identify the relationship between variables. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that allows for flexible   and scalable data storage. MindsDB is an open-source automated machine learning framework that allows for easy model training and prediction. In this tutorial, we     will use MongoDB and MindsDB to perform regression analysis on a sample dataset.

# Prerequisites

  To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

  - MongoDB installed on your local machine
  - A dataset to perform regression analysis 
  - MindsDB installed on your local machine
  
# Step 1: Connecting Data
  
  Before we can perform regression analysis, we need to connect to our MongoDB database and retrieve the data we want to analyze. To do this, we will use MongoDB Query   Language (MQL) statements.

  Here's an example MQL statement to retrieve data from a "books" collection:
  ```lua
  db.books.find()
  ```
  This statement will retrieve all documents from the "books" collection. You can run this statement in the Mongo Shell or in Mongo Compass.
  
  Example output:
  ```css
  {
  "_id": ObjectId("60c8a75b76fc024b6f90eb1f"),
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "J.D. Salinger",
  "published_year": 1951,
  "pages": 277,
  "genre": "Fiction"
}
{
  "_id": ObjectId("60c8a75b76fc024b6f90eb20"),
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "published_year": 1960,
  "pages": 281,
  "genre": "Fiction"
}
{
  "_id": ObjectId("60c8a75b76fc024b6f90eb21"),
  "title": "1984",
  "author": "George Orwell",
  "published_year": 1949,
  "pages": 328,
  "genre": "Science Fiction"
}
{
  "_id": ObjectId("60c8a75b76fc024b6f90eb22"),
  "title": "Animal Farm",
  "author": "George Orwell",
  "published_year": 1945,
  "pages": 112,
  "genre": "Satire"
}
```
  Once we have retrieved the data we need, we can move on to the next step.
  

# Step 2: Creating/Training a Predictor

  Now that we have our data, we can use MindsDB to create and train a predictor. A predictor is a machine learning model that is trained to predict a target variable     based on other variables in the dataset.

  To create and train a predictor in MindsDB, we first need to install the MindsDB Python package. You can do this using pip:
  ```
  pip install mindsdb
  ```
  Once the package is installed, we can use the MindsDB CLI to create a new predictor. Here's an example command:
  ```
  mindsdb --config=mindsdb.config.json --create-predictor book_genre
  ```
  In this command, "mindsdb.config.json" is the configuration file for MindsDB and "book_genre" is the name we're giving to our predictor.

  Next, we need to specify the target variable we want to predict. In this case, we want to predict the genre of a book based on its other attributes. We can use the     following MQL statement to specify the target variable:
  ```bash
  db.books.analyze({$predict: 'genre'})
  ```
  This statement tells MindsDB to analyze the "books" collection and predict the "genre" attribute.

  Once we've specified the target variable, we can train the predictor using MindsDB. To do this, we can use the following command:
  ```
  mindsdb --config=mindsdb.config.json --train book_genre
  ```
  This command tells MindsDB to train the "book_genre" predictor using the data in our MongoDB database.

  MindsDB will automatically analyze the data and generate a model based on the best algorithm for the given problem. The model will be saved in the MindsDB database     and can be used to make predictions.
  
# Step 3: Making Predictions

  Now that we have a trained predictor, we can use it to make predictions on new data. To do this, we can use the following MQL statement:
  ```php
  db.books.predict({title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell', published_year: 1949, pages: 328})
  ```
  This statement tells MindsDB to use the "book_genre" predictor to predict the genre of a book with the attributes "title: '1984'", "author: 'George Orwell'",           "published_year: 1949", and "pages: 328".
  
  Example output:
  ```json
  {
  "genre": {
    "predicted_value": "Science Fiction",
    "confidence": 0.9708320174217224,
    "prediction_quality": 0.9598152933128717
     }
  }
  ```
  The output tells us that the predicted genre of the book is "Science Fiction", with a confidence of 0.9708320174217224 and a prediction quality of                     0.9598152933128717.

  We can use the same MQL statement to make predictions on other books by changing the attributes.
  
  
# Conclusion

  In this tutorial, we've shown how to use MongoDB and MindsDB for regression analysis. We've connected to a MongoDB database, created and trained a predictor using     MindsDB, and made predictions on new data using MQL statements. This is just a simple example, but the same principles can be applied to more complex datasets and     regression problems.

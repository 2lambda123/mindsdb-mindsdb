## Introduction

[MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) is is an open-source AI layer for existing databases that allows you to effortlessly develop, train and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models using SQL queries. 
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a community and data science platform that provides tools that enables users to build, train and deploy machine learning models based on open source code and technologies. 
**NLP**, or Natural Language Processing, is a subprocess of artificial intelligence that helps machines process and understand the human langage so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks. 
Some examples of NLP include machine translation, summarization, ticket classification, and spell check.

The following four NLP tasks are currently supported by MindsDB:

1. Text Classification
2. Zero-Shot Classification
3. Translation
4. Summarization

**In today's tutorial, I'll show you how to connect Hugging Face to MindsDB so you can perform NLP operations on your dataset.**

## Setup

Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation, either locally or
via [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/). 

*You can create a **free** MindsDB account and take advantage of their built-in SQL editor [here](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor).*

If you want to learn more about creating a free MindsDB Cloud account, follow
[this guide](/setup/cloud/). Another way is to set up
MindsDB locally using
[Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) or
[Python](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/).

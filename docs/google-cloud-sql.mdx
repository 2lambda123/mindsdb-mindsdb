This is the implementation of the Google Cloud SQL data handler for MindsDB.

[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server databases in the cloud.
## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the existing MindsDB handlers for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: the host name or IP address of the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `port`: the TCP/IP port of the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `user`: the username used to authenticate with the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user with the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `database`: the database name to use when connecting with the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `db_engine`: the database engine of the Google Cloud SQL instance. This can take one of three values: 'mysql', 'postgresql' or 'mssql'.


<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/postgres_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Google Cloud SQL instance, you need to create a datasource with the following syntax:

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE cloud_sql_mysql_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'cloud_sql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "db_engine": "mysql",
    "host": "53.170.61.16",
    "port": 3306,
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "example_db"
};
~~~~

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cloud_sql_mysql_datasource.example_tbl;
```

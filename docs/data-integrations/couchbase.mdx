This is the implementation of the Couchbase handler for MindsDB.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented using the `couchbase` library, the Python driver for Couchbase.
The required arguments to establish a connection are,

| Name                                  | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`                                | Host name or IP address of the Couchbase server.                                         |
| `bucket`                              | Port to use when connecting with the Couchbase server.                                   |
| `user`                                | User to authenticate the user with the Couchbase server.                                 |
| `password`                            | Password to authenticate the user with the Couchbase server.                             |
| `scope`                               | Scope to use for making queries based on a scoped context because, couchbase uses scope just like schema in mysql, but scopes are mandatory. N.B the scope is optional, if ommited, will default to _default                      |


## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to a Couchbase server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

<Tab>
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE couchbase_datasource
    WITH ENGINE = 'couchbase',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "user": "couchbase",
      "password": "password",
      "bucket": "test-bucket"
    };
    ```
    </Tab>

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,

<Tab>
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM couchbase_datasource.collection
    ```
</Tab>

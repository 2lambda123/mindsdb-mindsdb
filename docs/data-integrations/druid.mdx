## Druid

Apache Druid is a real-time analytics database designed for fast slice-and-dice analytics ("OLAP" queries) on large data sets. Most often, Druid powers use cases where real-time ingestion, fast query performance, and high uptime are important.
https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design.

## Implementation
This handler is implemented using the `pydruid` library, the Python API for Apache Druid.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `host`: the host name or IP address of Apache Druid.
* `port`: the port that Apache Druid is running on.
* `path`: the query path.
* `scheme`: the URI schema. This parameter is optional and the default will be http.
* `user`: the username used to authenticate with Apache Druid. This parameter is optional.
* `password`: the password used to authenticate with Apache Druid. This parameter is optional.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to Apache Druid in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used.

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE druid_datasource        --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'druid',                  --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                          --- host name or IP address of Apache Druid
  "port": ,                             --- port where Apache Druid runs
  "user": " ",                          --- optional, user to authenticate with Apache Druid
  "password": " ",                      --- optional, password used to authenticate with Apache Druid
  "path": " ",                          --- query path
  "scheme": " "                         --- the URI scheme (defaults to `http` if left blank)
};
~~~~

Now, you can use this established connection to query your data source as follows.

~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM druid_datasource.example_tbl

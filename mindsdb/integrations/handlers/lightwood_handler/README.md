## Installation

To use the Lightwood Handler, you need to have MindsDB installed on your system. Follow the MindsDB installation instructions, and the Lightwood Handler will be available for use.

## Usage

### Creating a Predictor

You can create a predictive model using the Lightwood Handler by specifying the target variable and providing the input data. Here's a basic example:

```sql
CREATE PREDICTOR my_lightwood_predictor
  USING ENGINE="lightwood"
  WITH
  - 'target' = 'target_column_name'
  - 'df' = <your_dataframe>;
```

Replace `target_column_name` with the name of your target column and <your_dataframe> with the input dataset.

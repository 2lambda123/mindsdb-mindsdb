## Notion API Handler

- This handler leverages the Notion API to interface MindsDB with Notion. This integration will empower users to employ MindsDB's capabilities, to automate tasks such as creating, modifying, and managing Notion pages, answering inquiries, creating bots and posting announcements within the Notion platform.

## Notion
- Notion is a freemium productivity and note-taking web application developed by Notion Labs Inc. It offers organizational tools including task management, project tracking, to-do lists, and bookmarking.

## To develop a new handler that leverages the Notion API to interface MindsDB with Notion, you can follow these steps:

 - Identify the Notion API endpoints that you need to use. The Notion API documentation provides a comprehensive list of all available endpoints.
-  Implement the new handler in MindsDB. The handler will need to implement the following methods:

 `connect()`: This method should establish a connection to the Notion API.
 
`disconnect()`: This method should close the connection to the Notion API.

`query()`: This method should execute a Notion API query and return the results.

`mutate()`: This method should execute a Notion API mutation to create, update, or delete Notion data.

- Then use `notion_handler.py` and follow further steps.

## To use this handler in MindsDB, you will need to add it to the HANDLERS section of the mindsdb.conf file. For example:

`notion = my_notion_api_handler.NotionAPIHandler`

- Once you have added the handler to the configuration file, you will need to restart MindsDB.

- Once MindsDB has restarted, you will be able to use the Notion API handler in your MindsDB queries. For example, the following query will return a list of all Notion pages in the workspace:

`SELECT * FROM mindsdb.notion.query({"type": "page"});`

## You can also use the Notion API handler to create, update, and delete Notion pages. For example, the following query will create a new Notion page:

`INSERT INTO mindsdb.notion.mutate(
    {"title": "My New Page", "type": "page"}
);
`
## The Notion API handler can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks within the Notion platform. For example, you could use it to:

    Create new Notion pages for every new lead in your CRM system.
    Update Notion pages with the latest data from your ERP system.
    Send notifications to your team members whenever a new task is assigned to them in Notion.
    Generate a weekly report of all completed tasks in Notion.
    Create a bot that can answer questions about your Notion data.

The possibilities are endless! With the Notion API handler, MindsDB can automate virtually any task related to Notion.

In addition to the basic `query()` and `mutate()` methods, you can also write custom methods for the Notion API handler. For example, you could write a method to create a new Notion database, or a method to update the properties of a Notion table.

## Description

The `CREATE TABLE` is used to create a table and fill it with the result of a
subselect, usually used to materialize predictions into tables.

## Syntax

You can use the usual `CREATE TABLE` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [integration_name].[table_name]
    (SELECT ...);
```

Or the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE [integration_name].[table_name]
    (SELECT ...);
```

It performs a subselect `[SELECT ...]` and gets data from it, thereafter it
creates a table `[table_name]` in `[integration_name]`. lastly it performs an
`INSERT INTO [integration_name].[table_name]` with the contents of the
`[SELECT ...]`.

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```

<Warning>
  "`REPLACE`" If `REPLACE` is indicated then `#!sql
  [integration_name].[table_name]` will be **Dropped**{" "}
</Warning>

## Example

In this example we want to persist the predictions into a table `int1.tbl1`.
Given the following schema:

```bash
int1
└── tbl1
mindsdb
└── predictor_name
int2
└── tbl2
```

Where:

|                  | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `int1`           | Integration for the table to be created in            |
| `tbl1`           | Table to be created                                   |
| `predictor_name` | Name of the model to be used                          |
| `int2`           | Database to be used as a source in the inner `SELECT` |
| `tbl2`           | Table to be used as a source.                         |

In order to achieve the desired result we could execute the following query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE int1.tbl1 (
    SELECT *
    FROM int2.tbl2 AS ta
    JOIN mindsdb.predictor_name AS tb
    WHERE ta.date > '2015-12-31'
);
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (x.xxx sec)
```
